An old Cherokee told his grandson:

“My son, there’s a battle between two wolves inside us all.

One is **Evil**. It’s anger, jealousy, greed, resentment, inferiority, lies and ego.

One is **Good**. It’s joy, peace, love, hope, humility, kindness and truth.”

The boy thought about it and asked:
“Grandfather, which wolf wins?”

The old man quietly replied:


_“The one you feed”_

Get fascinated when learning. Try to understand WHY something is. Find something fun, associate the material with something fun. Try to explain a fun subject, or use silly examples.

Ask yourself why. Then try and look an answer.

Pour yourself into it; read online.

Do it in small steps.

Disagree; question the teacher, don't take something for granted, but also don't hold to strongly to your believes

Teach it. Pretend you are giving a lecture and explain out loud.

Reflect on what you learned and share that to others

Previously, on NeverWinter Nights.

# Session 3: Defeat the Intellect Devourer

- Fairuza, Zaldar and Kraz (who was in the prison for destroying a dragon statue, which he thought was a real dragon) have defeated the Intellect Devourer. The Devourer had taken over the Warden, who was left catatonic, and resisted capture.
- Fairuza started an investigation to the Wailing Death. Tissue samples of diseased people didn’t respond to any regular treatments, leading her to think the disease is magical in nature.
- Entering Blacklake district, the adventurers heard a cry of help from a woman, she was being attacked by a thug.
- Another thug tried to surprise Fairuza, but failed. A battle ensued and the woman was revealed to be the leader of the two thugs, as it was an ambush.
- After defeating these would be assassins, it was revealed they carried descriptions of the party members, along with a short description of their specialties.
- An investigation to the Blacklake district was started. Fairuza covered the swaps, where it was found that it is now filled with dumped Wailing Death victims.
- The food shortage is due to a rich merchant called Meldanen.
- Sherry, a girl across from Meldanen, revealed he never enters or leaves through his front-door. She finds Meldanen creepy and doesn’t trust her neighbor.
- Sherry saw Meldanen’s butler leave with his suitcases, she thinks he was fired at the start of this week.
- Jenkin’s house is a smaller home. He has boarded up his ground floor windows.

# Session 2: Move until you drop!
- Quinthya, Fairuza, Moras and Crow took care of Bandit Captain down in the sewers. Interrogation didn't reveal anything new.
- The prison was charged, using stealth and tactical movement. Two guards were quickly put down.
- Once inside the prison, the group stealthily approached the first guard, who was guarding a hallway. Each of the three hallways was closeable by a gate, and protected by a guard. With some cunning positioning and heavy stealthing, each of the guards fell before the might of the party.
- Quinthya, Fairuza, Morass and Crow each recieved 200 XP.
- No loot was found.

- After a short talk with Lady Aribeth, they PC's decide to investigate the Scar District. Arriving at the Scar, they help a guard captain
- One of the inmates is captured. Interrogation reveals that a bandit leader in the sewers has a key to allow inmates into the prison. The Warden is in control of the prison, but he released the inmates. The inmates now follow him.

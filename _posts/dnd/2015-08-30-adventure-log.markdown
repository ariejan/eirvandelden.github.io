What happened previously in our D&D session

# Session 0: The Prelude
 - The city of NeverWinter is brought down to its knees by a strange disease; the Wailing Death
 - A call went out for new Heroes to come train at the Heroes Academy, to become the new saviour of NeverWinter
 - The Heroes Academy is attacked, but five brave adventureres fought back and prevent the Heroes Academy of falling
 - The cure of the Wailing Death, three creatures send by the city of Waterdeep, have gone missing.

  * For some reason, they are trying to go straight for Kalarel. Perhaps they believe that everything will end if they quickly kill Kalarel?
  * Take average damage that a creature can do into account. If there are four creatures that on average deal a quarter of the tanks hp, it takes a single round to kill a PC
  * Trap was a gratefull change, so mini games and puzzles are a go. Trap probably should have activated when someone crosses half the room, instead of directly
  * Under priest battle was too easy.
  * Battle with zombies was considered hard, but they made smar use of the doorway.
  * Still need to work on describing the room and the monsters, perhaps write a short piece on how I see th room and monsters?
  * Naivara has an Urn with Water

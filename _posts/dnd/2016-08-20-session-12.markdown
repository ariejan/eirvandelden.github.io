Party members of this session: _Little Crow, Moras, Zaldar, Fairuza_

# _**Date** 28th of Spring, 66016_

It was now time for the party to get the four items they need; _the book, the dagger, the mask and the bell_

## Hall of the Crimson Whip

- Two pools of blood separated by a stone walkway. At the far end were two pedestals, containing the haft and blade of the dagger.
- Fishing in the pools of blood revealed that the two large statues rotate with huge metallic whips, hitting everything within 7 squares.
- The first statue was rigged, it's range reduced to 5 squares.
- A body was pushed into the pool of blood. This revealed there is something that can strive in the blood.
- Another body is tied to the whip of the closest statue, and dropped into the blood. This triggers the minotaur statue, which makes a full turn, then drops the body into the blood. Which attracts the Carnage Demon, who subsequently gets thrown _out_ of the blood pool and gets hit by ranged attacks AND the minotaur statue.
- The second pool had two carnage demons, who were distracted by using another corpse and some coordinated movements.

### Colour Token Rewards

- Fairuza **White** _for walking through blood for the team_
- Crow **White** _for being the "Meatshield" of the party_
- Moras **Blue** _for coming up with a tactical plan to get the dagger_
- Zaldar **Blue** _for coming up with a tactical plan to get the dagger_


## Hall of the Howling Pillars

- A room filled with Pillars of tortured souls.
- The party used a table as a "shield" to navigate the room and stay clear of the pillars.
- Moras "grabbed" the Bell with an Indiana-Jones-kind of trick. This woke up the Barlgura and carnage demons in the room
- While Fairuza and Little Crow could quickly exit the room, Moras and Zaldar were randomly teleported to the worst position possible. With some more team effort, the group espaced the room with the bell_

### Colour Token Rewards

- Fairuza **White** _for chosing healing over damage during this encounter_
- Crow **White** _for going back to distract the demons, so Zaldar could escape_
- Moras **Black** _for valiantly running away_
- Zaldar **Black** _for valiantly hiding from the enemies_

## Hall of Enforced Introspection

- Hall filled with pillars, with magical mirrors on each side
- Zaldar covered himself up with a bedsheet and strode into the room, following the wall.
- At a crossing, Zaldar peaked underneath the bedsheet to see the layout of the room. Though randomly teleported by looking into one of the mirrors, he could convey how to continue.
- The whole group traveled to the end of the room, where another black curtain hung. Behind it, were two skeleton guardians.
- After defeating the skeletons the last item, the mask, was in the groups possession.

### Colour Token Rewards

- Fairuza **Blue** _for seeing that the best option to get close is to stand in front of a teleport mirror_
- Crow **Blue** _for "fighting" the skeletons by letting them look into the mirrors_
- Moras **Blue** _for "fighting" the skeletons by letting them look into the mirrors_
- Zaldar **Red** _for his impulse decision to just go into the room_

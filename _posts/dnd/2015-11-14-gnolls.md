Gnolls, Worgen, Werewolves, these are all names for the same canine like race.

The Gnolls of Deneki are not the ferocious species they are in most worlds. They value family and honour, though they do follow a life of battle. War is battle of flesh, politics is battle of the minds. Younger Gnolls tend to adult Gnolls, who are the honoured warriors of their species. Elder Gnolls, those too old to fight physically, become either Generals or Politicians.

Gnolls are not great craftsmen, nor are they great farmers. They have both, but they‚Äôd rather trade with other species for food and products.

Gnolls are commonly mercenaries, guards or spies/thieves.

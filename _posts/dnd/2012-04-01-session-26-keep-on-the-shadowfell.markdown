* Party went back to Winterhaven, taking Vlasov and Agrid (bound), received a letter to go to Winterhaven from Shippo
* Shippo was already in Wrafton's Inn, but not really surprised that his friends were already there, while expecting them in a day or four.
* Vlasov talked to Shippo, gave him a choice between _Basketball and Althea_
* Interrogated Agrid, within a sepperate room within the temple. Told everything from Bairwin to Kalarel (in some keep)
* Handed Agrid over to the Winterhaven Guards
* Went towards Kobold Cave, were ambushed, defeated the kobolds (by halving the encounter â€¦)

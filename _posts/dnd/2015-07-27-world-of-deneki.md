# Introduction
The world of Deneki is a "Medieval Steampunk" kind of world. Technology is a bit further than most D&D worlds, which are Lord of the Rings esque. 
The inhabitants of Deneki are experimenting with new machineries, powered by steam or magical stones.
They have inventions like guns (which quickly replaced bows), and lamps. And plumbing, because who can live without toilets?

The world of Deneki is a new world, but will contain familiar elements from different sources.

The Map of Deneki is equal to the D&D 4th Edition map of Faerun:

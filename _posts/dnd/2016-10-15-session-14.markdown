# Evaluation

## How happy were you with last session?

## What was good during this session

- Difficulty was high which I liked
- Cool boss fight in different phases.

## What could have gone better

- I would like the environments / personae to be more detailed properly. I had difficulty imagining the environment I was in.
- To many interuptions from the story, when we leveled up and looking up magical items. This could be done in between sessions. And we will have more time for the story.

## What are the players most curious about

- I would like to see what completion will add to our encounters. Also if there will be loot and or powers that use it or are related to it.
- Magic items!!! :P

## Anything else?

- I still think the enemies are too unpredictable, both in stats and their abilities. I would still say that statwise enemies need more HP and less damage. Ability wise if creatures have 3 abilities and they live around 3 rounds because of their HP they will effectively have a new unknown to the players ability each round which will mean the players have no possibility to predict their actions. Having such a large degree of RNG diminishes decision making.
- Keep up the good work

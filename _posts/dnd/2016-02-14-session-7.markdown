Party members of this session: _Little Crow, Fairuza, Quinthya, Moras, Ronny James Dio_

_**Date** 13th of Spring, 66016_

- The group agreed that they first want to talk with Lady Aribeth, before handing over the Waterdhavian Creature Components to make a cure
- During the talk with Lady Aribeth and Desther, the group caught on that Desther might be the culprit behind the Wailing Death
- Searching Desther rooms together with Lady Aribeth, the group found clues that 1 year ago something happened to Desther
- While confronting Desther with their suspicions, he attacked! He tried to get away, but was restrained.
- When the group defeated Desther, he revealed the following:
  - Lady Aribeth *is not* the real Aribeth, but *her twin-sister Seldra*. The real Aribeth is in a cell underneath Helm's Hold.
  - Three years ago, Seldra ordered the death of Aribeth. Desther secretly captured Aribeth instead of killing her and experimented and tortured her.
  - A year ago, Desther and his allies killed all the priests at Helm's Hold and took over their identities.
  - Seldra and Desther worked together to spread the Wailing Death. The "blessings" of Desther's Priests were the cause of the Wailing Death
  - Seldra has probably escaped
- While in Helm's Hold, the group also found Deekin to be alive
- While in Helm's Hold, there was already a small army of Wailing Death victims. They have been altered into metallic zombies.
- The group has found new magical items to use

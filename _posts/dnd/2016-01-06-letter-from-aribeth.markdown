_This post is for the players in the Neverwinter Nights campaign_

When you return to the Moonstone Mask, you see a sealed letter on your bed. Opening it reveals the following letter:

> Signed date: 23st of Spring, year 62015
>
> Dear Adventurers,
>
> On the 12th of Spring I have asked you all for your assistance in recapturing the Waterdhavian creatures, that have escaped the Neverwinter Heroes Academy.
> I haven’t heard from you all since.
> Have you been able to track down the Waterdhavian creatures? Is your mission successful?
>
> More and more people are afflicted with the Wailing Death each day. The death toll has risen to 5,000 people, almost 1/5th of Neverwinter’s entire population! We must find the Waterdhavian creatures and make a cure, fast!
>
> Luckily, I have also received good news; the Warden of the Neverwinter Prison has been found and the escaped prisoners have been captured, bringing relative peace again to the Scar District.
> I have also heard that the famish in the Blacklake District has ended with the discovery of a huge stash in the basement of Merchant Meldanen, along with records of a large slave trade within our city.
> If you all are the reason for this good news, you have our thanks!
>
> I hope to hear of you soon!
>
> With kind regards,
>   Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande of the Neverwinter Nine

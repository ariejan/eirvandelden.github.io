### What was good during this session

- Verschillende verhaallijnen. Mijn "geheime" opdracht. Goede manier van omschrijven, aanvallen van monsters. het casten van spells enz.

### What could have gone better

- rommelig begin, met het uitzoeken van items.  Ik had me ook iets beter kunnen voorbereiden, met het door lezen van de achtergrond.

### What are the players most curious about

- Hoe het verhaal verder gaat, tevens ontwikkeling van mijn verhaallijn.

### Anything else?

- Over het algemeel, prima. Erg vermakelijk

The group came up with a plan. They would barricade the door, using Krand's body and weapons. The chains on the floor were dragged to the only other entrance of this large hall. Rothyrn found a pair of secret entrances, which he used to estimate the number of goblins that would be coming. On his way back, he sabotaged these secret passage ways to prevent an attack from behind. A large pack of goblins came and a large battle ensued. It was a difficult battle (Keyan was cornered at almost knocked unconscious) but the Goddess of Luck was on the adventurings groups' side. After this battle, they went investigating the last unvisited rooms within the Chamber of Eyes. There they found a chest, that was smashed to pieces because Rothyrn was to stupid to try the keys he found. The chest contained a now broken bottle and green chainmail armor. Silk also found money and gems and Rothyrn found a Lifedrinker scimitar. From the corpse of one of the Duergar, Silk found a letter talking about slaves not yet delivered to someone named "Murkelmoor".

While everyone was resting, Rothyrn talked about his undercover mission with Brug. He told about the rounds he made with Brug, collecting "protection money" from different merchants. The first few merchants paid up, but not the duergar in the trading post, hidden away in a corner. That duergar threatened Brug, reminding Brug of his aid with resurrecting Bekkie,  Brug's dog. Eventually, Ranthor came by, to have Brug send a party to find Paldemar. Rothyrn believes that Brug is not one of the bad guys and happily complies. The name of the Duergar of the trading post? Grimmerzhul Murkelmoorâ€¦

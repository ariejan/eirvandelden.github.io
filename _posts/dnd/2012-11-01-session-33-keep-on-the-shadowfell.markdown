  * Kylar was killed and changed into a Shade.
  * Didn't play the Thing behind the Portal consistently, it should have been it's own creature with it's own initiative and opportunity actions with a range of 3. On the other hand, they PC's really needed it for adding the correct Thing would have killed the players.
  * The botched up their Insight checks, so no one pushed Kalarel into the portal
  * He was doing massive ammounts of damage and the players were actively working together to get him out of the circle and doing the most damage.

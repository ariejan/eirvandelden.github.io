Players present: _Hacklor, Ro√´l, Aermund_

- The group is in search of the **Forever Stone** within the **Mines of Madness**
- Ro√´l the Barbarian and Hacklor the Fighter were eaten by a Purple Wurm, who swallowed the outhouse they were investigating.
- Ro√´l the Sorcerer and Hacklor the Bard arrived to help Aermund the Pirate Cleric enter the Mines of Madness
- Aermund almost died beneath a tunnel collapse trap while entering the Mines of Madness
- The group reached a room with a super happy fun slide. At the end of the slide was weird green dust that temporarily blinds you.
- Ro√´l the Sorcerer finds a Duck-Helmet that makes him understand dwarven
- The group is ambushed by a group of Giant Lizard Skeletons. Followed by an ambush by Dwarf Skeletons.

Death is imminent. Will the group survive?

# Evaluation

## How happy were you with last session?

![Image of the happiness](/img/dnd/happiness/kabisa-session04.png)

## What was good during this session

- Good balance between RP, battle and puzzling. Also, dying characters. This adds more variety to the game. The 'Help Us' note on the door was a nice touch.
- Playing a "traditional" D&D game

## What could have gone better

- Moar playa's!
- Getting there on time :) Maybe one or two players more.

## What are the players most curious about

- How we're going to survive (if at all) the horde of dwarf skeletons and what we're going to find next.
- What else there is to explore. I hope we don't find the ?-stone in the chest that the skeleton dwarf is standing on, it'd be over too soon :D

## Anything else?

- Keep on doing that thing you do! :-)
- I think I'm starting to form an answer to the 30-year old question "Would D&D be something for me?"

Players present: _Hacklor, Roël, Aermund_

- The group is in search of the **Forever Stone** within the **Mines of Madness**
- Roël the Barbarian and Hacklor the Fighter were eaten by a Purple Wurm, who swallowed the outhouse they were investigating.
- Roël the Sorcerer and Hacklor the Bard arrived to help Aermund the Pirate Cleric enter the Mines of Madness
- Aermund almost died beneath a tunnel collapse trap while entering the Mines of Madness
- The group reached a room with a super happy fun slide. At the end of the slide was weird green dust that temporarily blinds you.
- Roël the Sorcerer finds a Duck-Helmet that makes him understand dwarven
- The group is ambushed by a group of Giant Lizard Skeletons. Followed by an ambush by Dwarf Skeletons.

Death is imminent. Will the group survive?

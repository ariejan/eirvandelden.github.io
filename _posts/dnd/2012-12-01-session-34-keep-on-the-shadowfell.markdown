  * PC's still have no clues how minions work.
  * Despite being a normal encounter, they had enormous difficulties fighting this encounter. Don't really know what the problem was. Was it the extra damage? The huge amount of creatures? I know that there were a lot of low attack rolls. And the hadn't slept first, so they didn't have any daily powers.
  * Antioch rolled a massive intimidate check and I decided to let all enemies attach him, which caused a choke point.
  * PC's still need work on how the game plays. Don't forget to let them check to add a feat and check AC values.
  * Running Cairn of the Winter King gives me some more time to finish Neverwinter. Francis asked to change to a Bard.
  * I must take more time during play to explain the environment and how the creatures look like, hinting at strengths and weaknesses.
  * Introduced a halfling merchant group, with a named NPC _Lannar Thisleton of the Thisleton Trading Company}_
  * The PC's need to take an extended rest.
  * If they succeed in defeating the Winter King, then they are only days behind Bairwin
  * Next session: Check if everyone has chosen a feat for 4th level. Also give Naivara the magical urn from Mordenkainen's Emporium.

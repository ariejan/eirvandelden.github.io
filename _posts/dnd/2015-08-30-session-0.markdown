[Intro movie](https://youtu.be/-0qA7n4-E-Y?list=PL5U1SRexN7RUzwjvhTESUq0Q-yH4O8QF2)

 - The city of NeverWinter is brought down to its knees by a strange disease; the Wailing Death
 - A call went out for new Heroes to come train at the Heroes Academy, to become the new saviour of NeverWinter
 - Five brave adventurers have answered the call
 - The PCs met with their mentor Deekin and recapped their training
 - The PC's took their exams and all easily defeated the master teacher
 - The PCs met with Aribeth de Tylmarande to receive their diplomas; but were attacked by Goblins
 - They left one Goblin, Rha, alive who explained that the goblins were forced to attack the Heroes Academy, or have their women and children killed. They were forced by a black hooded man with glowin white eyes
 - Aribeth explained that they have a cure for the Wailing Death, in the form of three creatures: an Intellect Devourer, a dryad and a Yuan-Ti. Aribeth fears that the people behind this attack are after the Waterdhavian creatures.
 - The characters convinced Rha to get the other goblins to stand down, in return of their help in freeing the women and children of Rha's clan
 - Most other teachers and students were killed
 - The characters found the courtyard where the Waterdhavian creatures were held. They met up with Desther, a priest of Rathma, and Fenthik, a politician and lover of Aribeth.
 - The man in dark leather and white eyes was heading towards one of the stables, but was stopped by the PC's. The man is revealed to be a young White Dragon
 - While the group defeated a dragon, the Waterdhavian creatures have escaped

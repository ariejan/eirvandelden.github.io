- Quinthya, Fairuza, Moras and Crow took care of Bandit Captain down in the sewers. Interrogation didn't reveal anything new.
- The prison was charged, using stealth and tactical movement. Two guards were quickly put down.
- Once inside the prison, the group stealthily approached the first guard, who was guarding a hallway. Each of the three hallways was closeable by a gate, and protected by a guard. With some cunning positioning and heavy stealthing, each of the guards fell before the might of the party.
- Quinthya, Fairuza, Morass and Crow each recieved 200 XP.
- No loot was found.

Players present: _Hacklor, Ro√´l, Aermund, La'urens_

- Dwarf Skeletons were defeated with help of La'urens, another of the adventuring group who overslept.
- Ro√´l has found the deed to the "Corkscrew Mines", whatever does are
- La'urens got stuck in a magical hallway, but got out by walking backwards
- The group found an Iron Hammer, only to be used "in case of Berserk Golem". Aermund took it along.
- The group found a door carved like a grinning dwarf. Hacklor and La'urens went through the mouth and are now made of jello (resistance to piercing & bludgeoning damage, and they no longer need to eat). Ro√´l and Aermund just used the door like a door.
- The group tried one hallway and found a fake door. Also, Hacklor newfound powers as a Jello-Humanoid were found useful, as he/she/it was stabbed by a trap.
- A mine shaft was found, with the ghost of a fallen dwarf at the bottom. No treasure was found on him.
- _DM's note, the group is now in area 20_

_"The Magnificent Buddy Bag, straight from Waterdeep!"_

  * First hints at Shippo not being able to exactly locate Steven, link felt cold.
  * Sister Nala was shown the letter from Urtok.
  * Date with Rinon went wel, Naivara was certainly interested in Rinon
  * First battle against Kir-Lanan's. Immobilize &Push effect should be more like the Kobold Shaman for consistency with the power. Fly by can be abbused more.
  * Fighting on two levels (on the beams and on the floor) was received well
  * Naivara went backt to Rinon's cabbin with him. She was bandaged by Rinon, while Althea went sneaking along. She was seen by Rinon's wolves and left in a tree. Rinon then escorted the three back to Winterhaven.
  * Naivara trusts Rinon, and he has gained Antioch's confidence. Althea doesn't trust him.
  * On Rinon's urging, the group went to Bairwin's Grande Shoppe, trying to get inside. He left towards the secret temple below his Shoppe
  * Players met with the mayor, Lord Padraig.

  * The players met Bl√∂dgharm, a young elf who was captured by Bairwin.
  * The players defeated Bairwin and brought him to Sister Nala.
  * _Bairwin hasn't been killed yet!_
  * Naivara picked up the role of Sister Nala and did well. _Perhaps take into account giving away roleplay roles every now and then._
  * Viktor Vlasov has told the players the history of the Keep
  * The players have decided to go to the keep _though they are not really sure why_
  * _Start playing all creatures smarter! Bullrush! Flank! Attack the ranged players! Use more brutes! Harder encounters!_

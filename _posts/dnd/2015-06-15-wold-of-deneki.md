# History

## Creation wars

Not much is known about these wars. This is when humanity arose.

## The First Mortal races (Gnolls, Elves, Halflings) arise

## Elven Wars

- War breaks out between elven clans. 
- The Sun Elves are banned from the sun, turning them into the Drow 

## First Divine Wars
- Heaven and Hell battle over Deneki 
- Heaven defeats Hell, claiming Deneki
- Heavens grip on Deneki is like an iron hand. There is no hunger nor poverty, as all basic needs are provided for. But there is also no fun and no advancements in any way. 
- The Loxodon are introduced to Deneki

## Second Divine Wars

- Rebellion breaks out against heaven
- Hell finds a new way to return to Earas and appears to be a saviour of the oppressed people of Earas. 
- Hell is no better than Heaven and a new rebellion breaks out.  
- Druidism and Necromancy arise, both want to keep the Balance between Good and Evil, Life and Death. 
- Both Heaven and Hell are expelled.
- The Second Mortal races arise during this period: Dwarves, Gnomes, Kobolds

## Gnome Banishment
- The Gnomes have an affinity for artifice, the creation of mechanics and mechanical creatures.
- They create the Warforged, a (later sentient) race of machines
- The Warforged view themselves as enslaved by the Gnomes. 
- The Gnomes feared the newfound sentience of the Warforged and tried to destroy the Warforged
- The Warforged won the war and exiled the Gnomes from their homeland, claiming it as their own.
- The Gnomes now wonder the world in search of a new home, or a new army.

## Creation of the Alliance Protectorate 
- Elves and Gnolls join forces to defend the North from many threats, orcs, dragons and beholders
- Later, the Halflings joined the alliance. 

## Now
- The North has greatly prospered through the Alliance Protectorate 
- Humans and Thieflings are trying them

Party members of this session: _a Bard, a Fighter and a Ranger_

- The group question the girl, Estrela:
  - She was in an accident at the Docks over 2 weeks ago. She remembered falling and then waking up somewhere else
  - There were evil men, "the Teachers", who wanted to teach her, and other children, evil things
  - She escaped through a pool of water and sewers
- The group visited the girl parents:
  - The parents claim that they buried their daughter 2 weeks ago. They had a body
  - This girl looks like their own daughter, even smells like her
  - If the group can explain what happened that they at the Docks, they can accept that this girl really is their Estrela.
- Visiting the Docks, a pier was found with a trapdoor underneath it.
- Underneath the pier is a tunnel. The group, and Estrella, followed the tunnel to a hatch

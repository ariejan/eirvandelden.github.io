Players present: _Hacklor, Ro√´l, La'urens_

- The players have found 2 elevators, leading up.
- Walked past the elevators and arrived in a circular room containing a gem and a corpse. Trying to grab the gem reversed gravity, falling upwards. Oh and there are spikes on the ceiling. Obviously.
- Ro√´l, the Sorcerer with very little hp, tied a rope to his middle and tried to grab the gem *again*. Then _Hacklor_ also tried again. Just to see if any variation would yield something good. No additional shinies were found.
- Went up the stairs, arriving at the upper floors where the elevators lead to.
- Found a door, which was not a door, but a Mimic! La'urens comically got both his hands, his short sword, his dagger and a set of dice stuck on the Mimic. The mimic is now a pile of dead stuff.
- The party heard chicken noises and found a group of 4 very large chickens. They later found out these were Cockatrices. Underneath an overturned mining cart the group found HugHug. HugHug is the sole survivor of a group of Goblins who enterend the Mines of Madness.

# Evaluation

## How happy were you with last session?

![Image of the happiness](/img/dnd/happiness/kabisa-session06.png)

## What was good during this session

- Pacing of the story is good, not too fast, not too slow.
- Had a lot of fun again! Managed to stay alive for another round!

## What could have gone better

- I need to improve my map drawing skills, sometimes the directions are difficult to follow.
- I should take more risks, it's more fun! The being said, I'd also like to examine rooms/stuff more.  There's also a nagging feeling I don't exploit all my abilities yet, because I'm not familiar enough with my character and the possibilities in D&D.

## What are the players most curious about

- If showing the slimy door my mirror would have turned it into a mirror considering it likes to take the shape of inanimate objects :-)
- What our brand new companion _Editor's note: HugHug_ is going to add to the story :D

## Anything else?

- Thanks :)

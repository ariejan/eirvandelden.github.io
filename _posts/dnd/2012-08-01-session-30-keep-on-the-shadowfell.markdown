  * _Bairwin hasn't been killed yet_
  * The players have asked Rinon to act as a guide. He sent the players through the backdoor, but they skipped the encounter with Kir-Lanan
  * Kylar used his Hidden Blade to kill the guards in the Entrance Room
  * They saved a child from the torture chamber. They first lured away the torturer  and then defeated the rest.
  * They met a first Shadow Steven copy. There were hints that more copy have been made
  * _Develop Magical Bow for Althea. Perhaps give it a Daily Area attack_
  * They know of the barracks area that there are two guards gambling
  * _Start playing all creatures smarter. Bullrush. Flank. Attack the ranged players. Use more brutes. Harder encounters_

# Delivering the slaves

## _**Date** 28th of Spring, 66016_

- Taffarof delivered the slaves and Little Crow to a Drow, who chained them to the wall
- Crow escaped and broke out
- In the meantime, Moras & Zaldar questioned Rebaroff. Rebaroff was on guard duty to protect "the Archeologist" when the Drow invaded the complex. He also explained that there are items needed to get to the inner sanctum of the Well of Demons
- The Soldier-Cyborg-Drow who accepted the slaves was stealth-killed
- The next Brute-Cyborg-Drow was slain in combat. Another, not cyborg, Drow escaped to get backup
- The backup was in the form of four Lizards and a Artillery-Cyborg-Drow. Despite being extremely strong, the group prevailed. Barely. Healing Potions were used
- The group met the ghosts of long dead adventurers who explained the group needs four items before entering the Inner Sanctum

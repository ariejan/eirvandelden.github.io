If you're in my D&D Group; these are the homebrew and optional rules we play with.

# Optional rules
During the campaign we use the following optional and homebrew rules:

- Feats **PHB 165**
- [Action Points](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/unearthed-arcana-eberron) **Unearthed Arcana: Eberron**
- Color Wheel Alignment **Homebrew, see below** 
<br />*This replaces the Alignment section from PHB Chapter 4*


# Color Wheel Alignment

Instead of the standard D&D Alignments, we have coloured alignments. 
Each colour stands for a personality trait. Your colour is based on your actions. 
There is no definition of Good or Evil between colours, Good or Evil are just two sides of the same coin, or in this case, Colour Wheel.

The five colours are:

- White
- Blue
- Black
- Green
- Red


## White
Stands for Order, Community and Morality.

- **Good example** Angels, Jedi (Star Wars), Friar Tuck (Robin Hood)
- **Evil example** Senator Palpatine (Star Wars), Dictators like Hitler (real world)

White actions have the **Radiant** keyword

## Blue
Stands for Logic, Knowledge and Technology

- **Good example** Spock (Star Trek), Mr. Fantastic (Marvel Comics)
- **Evil example** Lex Luthor (Superman), Two-Face (Batman)

Blue actions have the **Force** keyword

## Black
Stands for Amorality and Selfishness. Possibly Wealth

- **Good Example** Han Solo (Star Wars), Captain Jack Sparrow (Pirates of the Caribbean)
- **Evil Example** Sauron (LotR), Voldemort (Harry Potter)

Black actions have the **Necrotic** keyword

## Red
Stands for Freedom, Emotion, Chaos, Impulse

- **Good Example** Hulk (Marvel Comics)
- **Evil Example** Joker (Batman)

Red actions have the **Fire** Keyword

## Green

Stands for Instinct, Nature

- **Good Example** Radaghast the Brown (LotR), Wolverine (X-Men)
- **Evil Example** Green Peace (real world)

Green actions have the **Thunder** keyword

## Allied and Enemy colours
The allies of a colour are the two other colours that lie directly next to it, on the Color Wheel. For example, White is an Ally of Blue and Black is an Ally of Red
The enemies of a colour are the two colours opposite on the Color Wheel. For example, Black is an enemy of White and Blue is an enemy of Green and Red.
Enemies are super effective agains each other. Allies are not very effective against each other. Take this into account when using your Colour Tokens.


### Rules

- When ever you make a roll, you may give up a Colour Token to add an extra d6 to your role. You may declare your token before, or after rolling.
- Whenever you use a Colour Token to gain an extra d6, the action you take gains the color of the token.
- You may only give up a Token for a Colour you have the most. 
<br />For example; if you have 3 Green token and 1 Red, you may only use you Green tokens. If you have 2 Black tokens, 2 White tokens and 1 Blue token, you may use either a Black or a White token.
- If, at the start of the session, you have no tokens, you gain 1 Coloured Token of your choice. This should reflect your PCâ€™s personality
- If you end end a session with more than 0 tokens, you keep those tokens for the next session.

Dancer. Martial artist. Scientist. Software Developer. Dreamer. Curious. Unrelenting. Gentleman.

We humans are a many faceted race and each individual has many interests and skills. In this little piece of the internet, I give you a small peek of this particular human; to share anything I have found that might be useful. This can be anything related to Computer Science, Human Factors, Psychology, spirituality or even dancing or wushu.

Being curious by nature, I search and find answers to the many questions that I have. Perhaps you will find a solution to a problem, or affirmation to your own suspicions. “The Wisdom of one is like a tree without roots” as stated in Yamamoto Tsunetomo’s Hagakure; talk things over with others to get to the best solution. No single source is enough.

Please enjoy your stay. Perhaps you’ll find something useful for yourself.

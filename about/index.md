Born in 1988 and raised in Eindhoven.
Always had an interest in technology, starting with soldering my own chips with my grandfather. When we got our first computer, I was fascinated by software and how it all works. But working with Windows 95, 98LE, ME and 2000 got me thinking, can’t this be done easier? The answer came when my brother brought home an iBook G3. I was sold, immediately. After buying my own eMac running MacOS X, I knew what I wanted to do. Create software with an incredible User Experience.


## Hobbies 
I started dancing Streetdance with my older brother in 1998 at “Le Haen.” Later in 2000 I switched to Ballroom & Latin dancing, following my parents footsteps. From then on I’ve almost always been dancing. When I started dancing at ESDV Footloose, a student society in Eindhoven focused on dancing, I particpated in my first competition, the European Tournament for Dancing Students. Finding enjoyment in showing of my dancing, we quickly started dancing in other tournaments; the NTDS and Brado. Though I’ve now stopped dancing competitions, in 2012 my new dancing partner and I danced in the “Footloose Showcase: Around the World!”, a dance show.

In 2010 I started doing another sport: Wushu. Wushu is a chinese martial art (it is a “kung fu style”) that focuses on technique and dexterity, instead of actual fighting. I quickly realised how Wushu would improve my dancing and how my dancing could be used to enhance my kung fu. I started raining twice a week to quickly grasp the basics. Within a year I was participating in national and international competitions. I still practice wushu, as it is a great way to relax (just like dancing) and can be done anywhere, without the need of a partner (unlike dancing).


## Activities 
Currently I’m a student Computer Science & Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), finishing up my Bachelor. After my bachelor I want to continue studying, starting a master “Human Technology Interaction” also at the TU/e.
I’m currently employed at i-level services as a software developer. My other time is spent juggling between several things:
* ICT committee at ESDV Footloose
* Auditing committee at ESDV Footloose
* Personal programming projects
* Reading (which includes papers and books about design and programming)

Previous activities include:
* Junior Programmer at OGD
* Chairman at Student Society for Japanese Culture Kinjin
* ICT committee at JCES Kinjin
* Traditional Activities committee at JCES Kinjin
* Auditing committee at JCES Kinjin
